## Performance Improvements Achieved

### About Us Page: 87% → 94% (+7%) ✅

**Changes Made:**
1. Converted CSS `background-image` to `<img>` tag with `loading="eager"`
2. Enabled browser to leverage existing preload hint

**File Modified**: `/src/pages/AboutUs.tsx` (Lines 100-111)

**Before:**
```tsx
<div
  className="absolute inset-0 bg-cover bg-center bg-no-repeat"
  style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${restaurantInterior})` }}
>
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-black/70" />
</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="absolute inset-0">
  <img
    src={restaurantInterior}
    alt="Cairo By Nights restaurant interior - Authentic Egyptian decor and dining atmosphere"
    width={1920}
    height={1080}
    className="w-full h-full object-cover"
    loading="eager"
  />
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-black/70" />
</div>
```

**Results:**
- **Performance**: 87% → 94% (+7%)
- **LCP**: 4.0s → 3.0s (-1.0s, -25% improvement)
- **FCP**: 1.7s → 1.8s (stable)
- **TBT**: 0ms → 0ms (perfect)
- **CLS**: 0 → 0 (perfect)

**Analysis**: Converting from CSS background to `<img>` tag allowed the browser to properly prioritize the image with the preload hint, reducing LCP by 1 second.

---

### Function Room Page: 77% → 98% (+21%) ✅✅✅

**Changes Made:**
1. Reduced hero grid from 5 images to 3 images
2. Removed 2 preload hints (happyGuests, mainDish1)
3. Changed grid from `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3` to `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3`

**File Modified**: `/src/pages/FunctionRoom.tsx`

**Images Removed:**
- `happyGuests.webp` (118 KB)
- `mainDish1.webp` (83 KB)
- **Total removed**: 201 KB

**Images Kept:**
- `fullTable.webp` (90 KB)
- `restaurantInterior.webp` (148 KB)
- `egyptianDishes.webp` (100 KB)
- **Total remaining**: 338 KB (down from 539 KB)

**Before (5 images):**
```tsx
<div className="absolute inset-0 grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 p-4">
  <img src={fullTable} loading="eager" />
  <img src={restaurantInterior} loading="eager" />
  <img src={happyGuests} loading="eager" />
  <img src={egyptianDishes} loading="eager" />
  <img src={mainDish1} loading="eager" />
</div>
```

**After (3 images):**
```tsx
<div className="absolute inset-0 grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 p-4">
  <img src={fullTable} loading="eager" />
  <img src={restaurantInterior} loading="eager" />
  <img src={egyptianDishes} loading="eager" />
</div>
```

**Results:**
- **Performance**: 77% → 98% (+21% - MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT!)
- **LCP**: 6.2s → 2.2s (-4.0s, -65% improvement!)
- **FCP**: 1.7s → 1.8s (stable)
- **TBT**: 0ms → 0ms (perfect)
- **CLS**: 0.006 → 0 (improved to perfect)

**Analysis**: Reducing from 5 to 3 images cut total hero image payload by 37% (201 KB). This allowed the browser to load remaining images much faster, dramatically improving LCP from 6.2s to 2.2s.

- TTI: 4.7s (80/100)

**Issue**: Previous test showed 97% performance with 2.4s LCP. Current test shows 82% with 4.7s LCP.

**Analysis**: This is likely testing variance due to:
1. Network conditions during test
2. Browser cache state
3. Server load
4. Lighthouse testing variability

**Recommendation**: Re-run Lighthouse 3 times and take median score. Index page has not been modified and previous tests consistently showed 97% performance.
